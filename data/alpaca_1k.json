Make sure you enunciate and avoid mumbling, particularly with new words.\n- Make sure you know your audience. For example, use different language when speaking to young kids than when presenting to adults.\n- Use body language to help convey your message and also to show confidence. Standing up tall, maintaining good eye contact, and using hand gestures are all effective ways to engage your audience.\n- Structure your speech around a main point, supporting it with evidence and relevant stories that keep your audience engaged.\n- Practice your delivery ahead of time and focus on current best practices. This can range from using videos to record your speech to employing AI tools to receive feedback. \n- Find ways to make your message memorable. Whether it's a funny story or interesting visual aid, providing your audience with something to relate to and remember will help them understand your point.",

        "output": "Robert Burns' \"A Red, Red Rose\" and Emma Lazarus' \"The New Colossus\" are powerful works that each offer unique perspectives on themes of love, hope and belonging. \"A Red, Red Rose\" is a love poem about unrequited love: the poet expresses his devotion for a faraway lover and stutters his words with passion as he professes his love. Lazarus' poem, on the other hand, reflects on the hopes of immigrants and those who seek a better life in America. While her poem has a heavy sense of patriotism and pride, her words carry an unspoken advocacy for worthy immigrants. \n\nThe style and structure of both poems is a stark contrast. Burns' poem has a traditional, lyrical flow with vivid imagery, while Lazarus' work is a sonnet with a strict rhyme scheme. This is reflective of the difference in the ways they portray their respective messages. While Burns' poem centers around romanticized and idealized love, Lazarus' work speaks to America as a country of immigrants, projecting hope and a greater future. \n\nDespite the differences, both poems offer a sense of optimism. Burns' poem implies that with passion and patience, things can still turn out right even though his own love life may not have. Lazarus' poem acknowledges the struggles that immigrants face, yet still speaks to nationalism and a greater dream ahead. Both writers draw attention to values of hope, courage and hope in the face of adversity. These two poems offer the readers different outlooks, yet remain united in their story of love, strength and courage.",

In this example, we would substitute x+2y=6 into 2x+4y=6 to get 2x+4(x+2y)=6, which simplifies to 2x+ 8x + 8y=6. Then, we can further simplify this equation to 10x+8y=6. Finally, we can solve for y by dividing both sides by 8, giving us y=3/4. We can then use this value to find x in the original equation: x+2(3/4)=6, which simplifies to x=3. Thus, the solution to this 2x2 system of equations is x=3 and y=3/4.",

Natural language processing involves understanding the structure, meaning and function of spoken sentences to form automatic responses or actions. GPT can be used to develop natural language processing models that can be used in applications like chatbots, document summarization, text-to-speech conversion, machine translation, and more. GPT technologies can also be used for text recognition and understanding for tasks such as text classification, text summarization and deep text understanding. GPT can also be used to develop natural language models that understand complex language structures, as well as extract relevant information from large bodies of text. Additionally, tasks such as information extraction, dialog systems, question answering and image caption generation can be implemented using GPT technologies.  This can help automate many tasks, allowing humans to save time and effort. By applying GPT to natural language processing, the possibilities are endless. \n11.

Find and place the white cross: Find the side with a solid white color and turn it until the edge pieces with white centers match up with the white side.\n2. Place the white corners: Hold the cube so that the solved center pieces face up and right. Turn the cube so that a white corner piece is in the forward-right-top position. If the corner you want is already in the top layer, turn the top layer until the desired corner is in the forward-right-top position. Then twist the upper layer so that the corner fits into the right slot. \n3. Solve the middle layer: Look for two edge pieces needing to be swapped and position them so that they form a line when viewed from the top. Then twist the middle layer so that the two edge pieces are in the correct slot.\n4. Solve the bottom cross: Look for the cross pieces and line them up with the cross on the bottom layer. Then twist the bottom layer until the cross pieces match up the correct slots.\n5. Position the yellow corners : Hold the cube so that the bottom layer has the solved cross. Line up the yellow corner pieces with the yellow side of the cube. Then twist the bottom layer until the corner pieces snap into place. \n6. Finally, solve the yellow edges: View the cube from the top and look for the two edge pieces which need to be swapped. Line up the two edge pieces so that they form a line when viewed from the top. Then twist the bottom layer until the two edges match up in the correct slots.",
